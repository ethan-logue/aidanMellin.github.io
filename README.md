I wanted to see what kind of additions I could make to my friend's portfolio website.

### Additions
<ul>
  <li>Added padding-right to h1 to make the white space the same on either side of the line.</li>
  <li>Added transition to button to make it scale on hover and moved it a bit away from the side so when it scaled, it wouldnt go off-screen.</li>
  <li>Added transition to .blog-container to make the colors invert on hover.</li>
  <li>line 112 html: got rid of the inline styling and put class="resume-link" and made it have a hover effect and added some whitespace above it.</li>
  <li>In the same line gave <a class="underline" ... The underline class is a dyanmic underline effect that starts form the middle of the word.</li>
  <li>line 32 html: in each <a> tag, add the underline class to that as well.</li>
</ul>
